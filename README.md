# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Creating maps using USGS data to plt Earthquakes in the last 7 days
### Layering tectonic plates, street view, satellight view, and an extra color layer

## Resources:
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, USGS Maps, and Github linked maps

## Summary:
Tremors isnt just a great movie, it's also a name for the smaller quakes that happen globally. Along the fault-lines (tectonic plates)
we see the most activity as the molten underlayer causes the hard crust to shift and slide along itself. Larger earthquakes are found at subduction zones
(when one plate slides under another). These can also cause a tsunami if a large enough earthquake occurs. 

In the USA, Alaska and California see the highest number of earthquakes, mostly due to covering the largest surface area on an active plate. But don't rule out KY or TN for small tremors.
